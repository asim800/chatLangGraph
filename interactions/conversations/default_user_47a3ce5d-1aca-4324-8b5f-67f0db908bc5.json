      "content": "Of course! Calculating interest payments is essential for understanding the cost of borrowing or the return on investments. The formula for calculating simple interest is:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time\n\nWhere:\n- Principal is the initial amount of money\n- Rate is the interest rate per period\n- Time is the length of time the money is borrowed or invested for\n\nFor example, if you have $10,000 invested in a savings account with an annual interest rate of 3% for 2 years, the interest earned would be:\n\nInterest = $10,000 x 0.03 x 2 = $600\n\nThis means you would earn $600 in interest over the 2-year period. \n\nIf you have a specific scenario you'd like help calculating interest for, feel free to provide the details for more personalized assistance.",
