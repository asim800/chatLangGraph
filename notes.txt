  Based on your snippet, you still need to:

  1. Set Environment Variables - Add OPENAI_API_KEY in Vercel dashboard
  2. Update Next.js Environment - Set FASTAPI_CHAT_URL in your Next.js finance app
  3. Commit Changes - The deployment configuration changes should be committed

    - Add OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual OpenAI API key
    - After adding, redeploy with: vercel --prod
  2. Test Endpoints:
    - Chat Interface: https://fastapi-chat-langgraph-2wgwdbqqs-asim800s-projects.vercel.app/
    - API Docs: https://fastapi-chat-langgraph-2wgwdbqqs-asim800s-projects.vercel.app/docs
    - Available Prompts: https://fastapi-chat-langgraph-2wgwdbqqs-asim800s-projects.vercel.app/api/prompts
  3. Update Next.js Environment:
  In your Next.js finance app, update .env.local:
  FASTAPI_CHAT_URL=https://fastapi-chat-langgraph-2wgwdbqqs-asim800s-projects.vercel.app
  4. Commit Changes:
  The deployment configuration changes should be committed to your repository.

  Would you like me to test the deployment endpoints once you've set the environment variables?
  
  

  
  
vercel env add OPENAI_API_KEY production


issue is that Vercel expects Python functions to be in the api directory. Let me move the main.py file:

●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Option 3: API Routes Proxy - Step by Step Plan

    Overview

    Add FastAPI chat engine to your existing Next.js finance app using API route proxies. This keeps both codebases 
    separate while providing access at mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic.

    Step-by-Step Implementation

    Step 1: Deploy FastAPI Chat to Vercel (Separate Project)

    1. Create new Vercel project for FastAPI chat engine
    2. Add Vercel configuration files to FastAPI project:
      - vercel.json - Vercel deployment config
      - main.py - Entry point for Vercel
      - Update requirements.txt - Ensure all dependencies listed
    3. Deploy FastAPI to Vercel (gets URL like fastapi-chat-xyz.vercel.app)
    4. Test FastAPI deployment - Ensure it works standalone

    Step 2: Add Proxy API Routes to Next.js Finance App

    1. Create proxy file: src/app/api/fastapi/[...slug]/route.ts
    2. Implement request forwarding - Forward all requests to FastAPI Vercel deployment
    3. Handle all HTTP methods - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    4. Preserve headers and body - Ensure proper request forwarding

    Step 3: Environment Configuration

    1. Add environment variable to Next.js: FASTAPI_CHAT_URL=https://your-fastapi-deployment.vercel.app
    2. Update CORS in FastAPI - Allow requests from mystocks.ai
    3. Test connection between proxy and FastAPI

    Step 4: Testing and Verification

    1. Test basic endpoints:
      - mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/ - Should show FastAPI chat interface
      - mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/docs - Should show API documentation
      - mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/api/chat - Should handle chat requests
    2. Test React pattern functionality
    3. Verify tool integration works through proxy

    └── [all existing files unchanged]

    Key Code Changes

    1. FastAPI main.py (New File)

    from web_chat import app
    # Vercel entry point

    2. FastAPI vercel.json (New File)

    {
      "functions": {
        "main.py": { "runtime": "python3.9" }
      },
      "routes": [
        { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/main.py" }
      ]
    }

    3. Next.js Proxy Route (New File)

    // src/app/api/fastapi/[...slug]/route.ts
    export async function GET/POST/etc(request) {
      // Forward to FastAPI deployment
    }

    4. Environment Variables

    # Add to Next.js .env.local
    FASTAPI_CHAT_URL=https://your-fastapi-deployment.vercel.app

    Access Points After Implementation

    - FastAPI Chat Interface: mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/
    - FastAPI API Documentation: mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/docs  
    - Chat API Endpoint: mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/api/chat
    - All other FastAPI routes: mystocks.ai/api/fastapi/agentic/[route]

    Benefits

    ✅ Minimal changes - Only add proxy files to existing Next.js app
    ✅ Independent codebases - FastAPI and Next.js remain separate
    ✅ Easy cleanup - Just delete proxy files when done
    ✅ Same domain - Everything under mystocks.ai
    ✅ Quick deployment - Reuse existing Vercel setup

    Timeline

    - Step 1: 30 minutes (FastAPI Vercel setup)
    - Step 2: 15 minutes (Add proxy routes)
    - Step 3: 10 minutes (Environment config)
    - Step 4: 15 minutes (Testing)
    - Total: ~1.5 hours for complete setup
=========================


Great! I can see that the LLM is now showing much more detailed reasoning and planning multiple tool calls. However, I
  notice that it's planning multiple actions in a single step rather than executing them one by one. This is closer to
  what you wanted, but let me make one more adjustment to encourage actual sequential tool execution.

  The issue is that the LLM is planning all steps at once rather than executing them sequentially. Let me modify the
  system prompt to be more explicit about sequential execution:
  
⎿  Updated web_chat.py with 5 additions and 3 removals 
=====  ⎿  Updated web_chat.py with 5 additions and 3 removals =================================================================================
       127    - Be thorough in your Thought sections - explain your strategy and why you need each tool
       128 -  - If you need multiple pieces of information, plan it out clearly
       129 -  - Use multiple tool calls when necessary 
       130 -  - Always explain what you expect to learn from each tool
prompt modified for web access:
       128 +  - Execute tools ONE AT A TIME - after each Action/Action Input, wait for the Observation
       129 +  - If you need multiple pieces of information, execute tools sequentially, not all at once
       130 +  - After each Observation, have another Thought section to decide your next action
       131 +  - Always explain what you expect to learn from each tool before using it
       132    - Show detailed analysis in your final reasoning
       133 +  - Never plan all actions at once - execute them step by step
