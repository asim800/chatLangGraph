To do this effectively, we can break down the process into smaller steps:\n\n1. **Identify Portfolio Holdings**: We need to know the assets in your portfolio. Could you provide a brief description or list of the investments you hold?\n\n2. **Calculate Risk Score**: Once we have the portfolio holdings, we can calculate the risk score of your portfolio. This will help us understand the level of risk you are exposed to.\n\n3. **Analyze Diversification**: We can also analyze the diversification of your portfolio to see if you are adequately spread across different asset classes.\n\nShall we proceed with step 1 and gather information about your portfolio holdings?",
